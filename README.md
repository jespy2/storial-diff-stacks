# Storial Different Tech Stacks

## Stretch Features

This repo is my exploration of different tech stacks and a personal challenge to onboard new (to me) frameworks, libraries and languages.

The main project (Main MERN) is the local verision of the Storial 2.0 project found [here](https://github.com/jespy2/storial-2.0), which was build with a MERN/TS/Redux Toolkit/Tailwind.CSS/React Testing Library stack.  For each variation, I'll refactor using at least one major change in the stack used.
